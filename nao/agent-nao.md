# Networked Agentic Organizations (NAOs)
## The Evolution Beyond DAOs

**Identity-First Organizations for the Future of Work**

*Built on Self-Sovereign Identity & Agentic Intelligence*

**Script:** "Good morning everyone. Today I want to share with you the next evolution in organizational design - Networked Agentic Organizations, or NAOs. While DAOs promised decentralized governance, they've encountered significant limitations. NAOs represent a fundamental shift from token-based to identity-based organizations." *[30 seconds]*

---

### Slide 2: The Problem with DAOs
## DAOs: Promise vs Reality

**The Promise:**
- Decentralized governance
- Community ownership  
- Transparent decisions
- Global participation

**The Reality:**
- ❌ Wealthy token holders control decisions
- ❌ Anonymous participants, no expertise verification
- ❌ Immutable smart contracts = organizational rigidity
- ❌ Financial speculation over operational excellence


---

### Slide 3: Introducing NAOs
## Enter NAOs: Identity-First Organizations

### Key Question Shift:
**"How much do you own?"**
⬇️
**"What can you contribute?"**

**Built on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) + Agentic Intelligence**


---

### Slide 4: Core Components
## NAO Foundation: Three Pillars

### Self-Sovereign Identity
- Own & control your digital identity
- Portable credentials & reputation
- Selective disclosure privacy

### Agentic Identity  
- AI agents as verified participants
- Human-AI collaborative governance
- Reputation-based accountability

### Social Graph
- Relationship-aware governance
- Trust network integration
- Organic team formation


---

### Slide 5: How NAOs Work
## NAO Network in Action

```
[Expert A] ←→ [AI Agent] ←→ [Expert B] ←→ [Contributor]
```

**Reputation flows through verified relationships**
- Contributions build cross-network reputation
- AI agents provide consistent, expert analysis  
- Social graph reveals optimal collaboration patterns
- Governance adapts based on proven expertise

### Slide 6: DAO vs NAO Comparison
## DAO vs NAO: Side by Side

| Aspect | DAOs | NAOs |
|--------|------|------|
| **Governance** | Token-weighted voting | Reputation-based consensus |
| **Identity** | Anonymous wallet addresses | Verified credentials & expertise |
| **Adaptability** | Rigid smart contracts | Organic evolution |
| **Participation** | Binary (token holder or not) | Graduated based on contribution |
| **Resource Allocation** | Algorithmic, token-based | Context-aware, merit-based |

---

### Slide 7: Real-World Applications
## NAOs in Practice

### 🧬 Research Collaboratives
Scientists across institutions collaborate based on expertise, not institutional boundaries

### 💻 Open Source Projects  
Developers gain influence through code quality and community contribution

### 🎨 Creative Collectives
Artists collaborate dynamically with fair compensation based on contribution

### 💼 Professional Networks
Consultants form project teams based on verified expertise and collaboration history
